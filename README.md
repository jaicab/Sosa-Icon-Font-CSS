Sosa-Icon-Font-CSS
==================

A CSS file for Sosa Icon Font. Credits: All the credit for the font goes to Ed Merrit from TenByTwenty (http://www.tenbytwenty.com/sosa.php).

How does it work? 
-----------------
Start by linking the style.min.css file to your html head.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="your_path/style.css"/>
```
Remember: The font folder and style.min.css file must be both on the same folder.

Then simply create a span with the class of the icon you like. You can check the classes in the index.html file.
